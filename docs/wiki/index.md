Notations of Time Used in this Document
The scholars of the Order of Kora frequently measure time starting from the Breaking and moving forward using “Standard Years” (or the approximate time it takes for light to travel 10,000,000,000,000 km, roughly equivalent to one earth year). When referencing years prior to the breaking, scholars of the Order frequently use the abbreviation “B.B.” or “Before Breaking”. When there may be some ambiguity between times referenced from both before and after the breaking one can also use the abbreviation “A.B” or “After Breaking”.

At some points in this document there may be references to events and timelines specific to a given planet, system, or people. In these cases the local measures of time will be used in place of the Standard.
