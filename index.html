<p>Notations of Time Used in this Document
The scholars of the Order of Kora frequently measure time starting from the Breaking and moving forward using “Standard Years” (or the approximate time it takes for light to travel 10,000,000,000,000 km, roughly equivalent to one earth year). When referencing years prior to the breaking, scholars of the Order frequently use the abbreviation “B.B.” or “Before Breaking”. When there may be some ambiguity between times referenced from both before and after the breaking one can also use the abbreviation “A.B” or “After Breaking”.</p>
<p>At some points in this document there may be references to events and timelines specific to a given planet, system, or people. In these cases the local measures of time will be used in place of the Standard.

<h2 id="the-well-and-its-axes">The Well and its Axes</h2>
<p>The Well is the source of all power and energy in the Ythamos, and is the trunk of the tree of existence. The Well is not a physical place or object, nor does it truly exist in any real singular way in any other realm. The Well permeates every particle of matter from the smallest sub-quantum particle. Each minute portion of energy in the universe, be it wave or particle, is imbued with three axes: the Axis of Form, the Axis of Cognition, and the Axis of Identity. These three axes can be thought of as a kind of polarization of energy into three spectrums, where energy within each axis is bound to the laws of that axis.</p>
<p>Magic in the Ythamos is not just a way to hand-wave and obscure plot points that otherwise wouldn’t make sense, it is a science. As with any other science, magic in the Ythamos has many different branches and practices. The use and practice of magic varies widely across the Ythamos, the only similarities to be found from place to place are those that are imposed by the fundamental laws of the Ythamos.</p>
<p>Magic in the Ythamos is fundamentally the manipulation of existence through the alignment and manipulation of Axes. The practical meaning of this is that magic across the Ythamos is enacted through mechanisms that are known to have interactions with the Axes of the Well. The first, most commonly known of these mechanisms is to align some aspect of oneself with the Axes in the surroundings. This can be done through meditation, physical motions or exercises, or through some portion of the identity of a person or thing. In truth this mechanism is what underlies all other mechanisms of executing magic.</p>
<p>In almost all practical settings it is not so important to know these underlying principles of magic as it is to understand that all energy and existence comes from the Well, and that the Well is composed of three fundamental parts, called Axes. The Axis of Form, the Axis of Cognition, and the Axis of Identity. The combination of these three Axes define what is reality, and through the nature of self-awareness and intelligence that humans have they can intentionally change the interactions that they or objects they control have with these Axes to enact changes to reality. This is magic in the Ythamos.</p>
<h2 id="aspects-of-the-well">Aspects of the Well</h2>
<p>As stated in the previous section, there are three major Axes. These three Axes are known at some level as Aspects of reality, or of the Well. What this means is that they form a major part of what the Well is and how it forms existence. It is possible for there to be minor, and even other major Aspects of the Well. There have been none as of yet that have arisen to the level of becoming another major Axis of the Well, but there are many who have become Aspects of the Well in some capacity or another.</p>
<p>Aspects of the Well are beings or objects that have through magic created what is known as a minor Axis. A minor Axis is much like one of the major three Axes, a pathway through which the Well defines reality. The difference between one of these major Axis and a minor one is that the minor Axis only has effect on a minor portion of the Ythamos, not the entirety of existence. In practical terms this means that those that are Aspects of the Well have a direct effect on reality in their immediate vicinity, both in Form, Cognition, Identity, and derivative areas. One other effect of becoming linked with a minor Axis is that whichever being or object did the linking now has much higher access to raw energy from the Well giving them the ability to enact magic at much higher levels of power and reach.
Charters of the Ythamos
A charter is a work of magic that was invented by the council of Kora during the invasion of the Evil One. The council discovered that they could form an enchantment that could preclude certain types of magic or intentions from being enacted. They did this by forming creatures of Cognition known as Guardians of the Charter that would constantly search for and kill any magician that enacted a banned form of magic. Some of the forms of magic that were banned were necromancy, nuclear magic or magic of the atom, torture using magic, and others. This first charter was widely successful, but had a weakness in that it could not enforce itself on pre-existing spells and enchantments as it could not reliably ascertain the caster, and spells that drew their energy from a non-living source were widely thought to be impossible to counter in this way.</p>
<p>After the destruction and evacuation of the Kora homeworld the eight Aspects along with many councils of mages on new home planets formed new charters to govern the use of magic on those new worlds. These charters function in many different ways, and have wide-ranging effects on the way magic is used on those worlds.</p>
<h3 id="the-magic-of-thought">The Magic of Thought</h3>
<p>The magic of thought is magic that is primarily enacted through interactions with the Axis of Cognition. The easiest and most frequently seen method of doing this is through meditation, learning, and focus. This kind of magic can also be wrought in times of high emotion so long as that emotion does not defy reason and transcend into the Axis of Identity.</p>
<p>The magic of thought is somewhat limited in its ability to affect the physical world. It can draw energy from the Axis of Cognition to effect some limited physical changes but this is the most difficult way to do this. It is much easier to use the Axis of Cognition to draw on energy from the Axis of Form to affect the forms of things.</p>
<p>Common usages of the magic of thought are psychic magic, reading and sharing of thoughts, projections of the mind, storage of learning and memory, and as a guiding fence on energy from other forms of magic.</p>
<h3 id="the-magic-of-physical-elements-and-motion">The Magic of Physical Elements and Motion</h3>
<p>This is the form of magic related to the Axis of Form. It is the most frequently overlooked when viewing each form of magic separately as it is severely limited in the scope of what can be done when not combined with magic of another form. It is however the magic with the greatest effect on the physical world. This is the magic that when combined with guidance from the Axis of Cognition or Identity can be used for elemental magic, telekinesis, material alchemy and other forms of material enchantment, and is frequently used to augment the physical attributes and abilities of humans.</p>
<h3 id="the-magic-of-identity">The Magic of Identity</h3>
<p>This is the magic related to the Axis of Identity. This is the least well understood magic of them all and has the most far-reaching effects. It is very difficult to perform and requires a very high level of self-awareness, learning, and planning to effectively master. The magic of identity has an effect on the way that objects and beings see themselves, and how others see them. This magic is about what makes each object in the universe unique and identifiable. This magic is sometimes triggered accidentally when a person’s being is changed in a fundamental way such as at the death of a loved one or in a fight for survival. To consciously enact this magic is extremely difficult, and is not as easily guided by the Axis of Cognition as is the Axis of Form.
