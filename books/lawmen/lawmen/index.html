<h1 id="lawmen-chapter-1">Lawmen : Chapter 1 :</h1>
<p>It was quiet in the town, the kind of quiet you get when there are only so many
people around and they are all gathered in one area. The sun was low in the
Western sky, golden rays of light casting long shadows along the road giving
everything a feeling of largeness. Despite this nothing in the town was truly
large by any measure of the word. The biggest building was Garn's inn and bar
situated right in the center of things, and it only had three rooms to rent.
The town wasn't even big enough to have a town hall, a mayor, or a sheriff.
When something went bad in this town, it was the local folk who dispensed
justice. It is exactly this kind of dispensation of justice that was occuring
down at Garn's place that evening.</p>
<p>Garn's place was the defacto meeting hall for town events because it was the only
place in town that had enough seats for everyone. That is there were usually enough
seats for all the folk that usually came to the yearly harvest celebration or the
winter festival. Today even Garn's place didn't have room for everyone. It seemed
as though everyone for fifty miles had come for today's gathering, there was Mirin
and his wife Lana from out near the ford, Bimi the miller was in as well, and of
course there were the town folk.</p>
<p>It's an odd thing that happens in small towns like this one out on the edge of
civilization. The folks that live in town mostly moved out here to get away from
something or other up in the big city, they're small town folk through and through.
Something happens though, when those who live far out on their own come in to town.
All the town folks seem more civilized. There's almost as much distrust and tension
between the out-of-towners and the town folk as there are between the city folk and
the town folk. Only thing is, the tension with the out-of-towners is hidden just
a little deeper.</p>
<p>This evening there were more out-of-towners at Garn's than there were town folk.
You could feel it in the air, the tension between them. So sharp it was like a knife,
you turn the wrong way just a little quick or fumble your fingers and you end up
with a gouge in your finger and blood on the floor. You could see it, too. Right
down the middle of Garn's common room, just a few feet empty of anybody and full
of distrust.</p>
<p>It was worse this particular evening than usual, because today the out-of-towners
had come to dispense justice on one of the town folk. Tam was standing up front
near the bar, still wearing his work day clothes. His dark hair was long enough
that sometimes it would get down into his eyes, but after a long day's work it had been
caked in place by dust and sweat above his brow. He had a serious look about him,
his eyes always seemed harder than stone, tonight they were like diamond.</p>
<p>"Inviting them <em>here</em>, where we have come to make a life for our families is
unacceptable!" his voice matched his eyes, hard as diamond. It was filled with
the passion of a father, and as he looked about the room no one could meet his eyes.</p>
<p>"We may have our differences but all of us here know the way of this town, we
know each other. These strangers will bring nothing but danger and heartache to
us and our families!"</p>
<p>As he spoke there were some on the town folk occupied side of the room
that were slowly nodding along, though they were also casting furtive glances
towards the back of the room as they did so. At the back of the room there was a
small knot of men, town folk, all dressed up nice for the meeting. There was mayor
Yari, and his right hand man Daron, then there were a few of those most uppity of
the town folk. Those that had come out here looking for something instead of running
from it. To be truly honest, this small group was the one causing all the tension.
The out-of-towners and town folk were generally amicable, though they didn't see
one another often enough. It was these few uppity folk that really set the thing
on edge, making it feel like no one in the room hardly knew each other.</p>
<p>Tam was really getting into it, giving his speach, and down there in the back mayor
Yari gave Daron a nudge. Daron interrupted mid-sentence, shouting out with his
somewhat higher-pitched voice than his large stature would suggest</p>
<p>"</p>
